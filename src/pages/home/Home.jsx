export const AnswerTwo = ()=>(
  <div className="home-question">
    <h4>What is the Minimum i can Send?</h4>
    <p>Technical Proof
       We accept as little as 1 USD. All funds below $1 will be returned back to their owners.
      In some cases, our banking partners may not accept $1. We will contact you on such rare occasions. Mobile Money however accepts all amounts.
    </p>

export const AnswerThree = ()=>(
  <div className="home-question">
    <h4>How Fast will the GHS be Received?</h4>
    <p>Technical Proof
      Our systems typically take only a few minutes to process payments.
      Delays may be from either the blockchain you decide to use or our Mobile Money and banking partners. Never from us. Some transactions may not work at midnight or after working hours. Any such transactions may be completed in the morning.
    </p>
  </div>
)

export const AnswerFour = ()=>(
  <div className="home-question">
    <h4>Will Taxes and Transaction Fees affect the GHS to be Received?</h4>
    <p>
    Your recipient will receive the exact amount sent after converting USD amount to GHS rate. We incur all taxes and transaction fees.
    However when you are sending crypto to us, your blockchain or exchange provider may deduct a fee from you.
     </p>
  </div>

export const AnswerFive = ()=>(
  <div className="home-question">
    <h4>I made a mistake, How do i reverse the transaction?</h4>
    <p>
    We will not be responsible for loss of funds if you make a mistake.
In Crypto you cannot reverse a Transaction after it has been sent.
However if you are able to contact us in time before we make the GHS Fiat Payments we will be able to reach out to our banking or mobile money partners to reverse the transaction.
If you believe you were scammed we will help you lodge a police report at a fee.

  <div className="home-question">
    <h4>What are your Working Hours?</h4>
    <p>
      24/7. We work around the clock and have agents on shift at all times.
      We cant say same for our banking or mobile money partners though. This is because some transactions may not work at midnight or after working hours. Any such transactions may be completed in the morning.

export const AnswerEight = ()=>(
  <div className="home-question">
    <h4>Where Can i Find my Transaction ID?</h4>
    <p>
    Your Transaction ID all its details will be found on the confirmation message pdf doc. The confirmation message pdf doc is autodownloaded once you click on SEND TO GHS.
    Alternatively, you may also copy your Transaction ID and paste in a safe place.
    If you did not receive an autodownload please talk to our customer support.
